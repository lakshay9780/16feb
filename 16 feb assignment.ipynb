    "Database:\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that a computer program can quickly select, retrieve, and manage data.\n",
    "It is a systematic and organized set of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.\n",
    "Databases are designed to manage large volumes of data efficiently and provide mechanisms for data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: relational (SQL) databases and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Relational) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure:\n",
    "   - SQL databases are relational databases, meaning they use a structured schema and tables to organize and store data.\n",
    "   - Data is organized into tables with predefined columns and relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema:\n",
    "   - SQL databases have a fixed schema, which defines the structure of the data in advance.\n",
    "   - Changes to the schema can be complex and may require data migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language:\n",
    "   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with SQL databases.\n",
    "   - SQL provides a powerful and standardized way to query, insert, update, and delete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability:\n",
    "   - SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases:\n",
    "   - Suitable for applications where the data structure is well-defined and unlikely to change frequently.\n",
    "   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "   - Data can be stored in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing flexibility in the types and structure of data stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases may use various query languages, depending on the type (e.g., MongoDB uses a JSON-like query language).\n",
    "   - Querying may be less standardized compared to SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning you can handle more traffic by adding more servers to a distributed database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases:\n",
    "   - Suitable for dynamic and evolving data with changing requirements.\n",
    "   - Well-suited for applications with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis, Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "- Schema:\n",
    "  - SQL databases have a fixed schema.\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a dynamic schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query Language:\n",
    "  - SQL databases use SQL for queries.\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases may use various query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability:\n",
    "  - SQL databases are typically vertically scalable.\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Cases:\n",
    "  - SQL databases are suitable for well-defined, structured data.\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases are suitable for dynamic and evolving data with changing requirements."

    "DML statements primarily include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. These statements allow you to add, modify, and remove data from database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "\n",

    "INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Age)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 25);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a new row is added to the `Students` table with values for the columns `StudentID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age`. \n",

    "\n",

    "INSERT INTO Students (FirstName, LastName, Age)\n",
    "VALUES ('Jane', 'Smith', 22),\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This inserts two rows into the `Students` table with different sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing data in a table. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE Students\n",
    "SET Age = 26\n",
    "WHERE StudentID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Age` of the student with `StudentID` 1 is updated to 26. The `WHERE` clause is crucial to specify\n",
    "which rows should be updated; otherwise, all rows in the table would be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DELETE` statement is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM Students\n",
    "WHERE StudentID =2;\n",
    "\n",
    "This example deletes the student with `StudentID` 2 from the `Students` table. As with the `UPDATE` statement, \n",
    "the `WHERE` clause is important to avoid accidentally deleting all rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to use caution when using `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements, especially without a `WHERE` clause, as they can modify or remove data irreversibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DML statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`) are fundamental for manipulating data in a relational database, \n",
    "allowing you to add, modify, and remove records to maintain the integrity and accuracy of your data."
